### Installation üëÄ

1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/faceit-level/releases).
2. Everything is drag & drop, so i think you can do it!
3. You can either make the workshop addon yourself or use ours that it's publicly available [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3369129706)

### Instructions on making the addon üìù

1. Download the `workshop.rar` archive from the GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to your game files, which by default are in: `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo` and open the `gameinfo.gi` file. There, scroll down until you find `VpkDirectories`, add a new entry with the `panorama/images/econ/status_icons` path, it should look like this:
   `"include" 		"panorama/images/econ/status_icons"`
3. Open the Workshop Tools and make a new addon, there, upload the `panorama` folder from the archive onto `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo_addons\YOUR_ADDON_NAME` and onto `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\content\csgo_addons\YOUR_ADDON_NAME`
4. Upload the addon to the workshop and wait for the approval.
5. Delete the entry that we did in gameinfo.gi, (this is the important as you can't join any community servers with modified gameinfo.gi)

### Configuring the plugin üßê

- After installing the plugin, you need to change the default values from `addons/swiftly/configs/faceit-level.json`
